  submitter_read_group_id:
    description: The identifier of a read group; must be unique within each payload.
    name: submitter_read_group_id
    range: string
    title: Submitter Read Group Id
    required: true
  submitter_experiment_id:
    description: Unique identifier of the experiment within the study, assigned by the data provider.
    name: submitter_experiment_id
    range: string
    title: Submitter Experiment Id
    required: true
  file_r1:
    description: Name of the sequencing file containing reads from the first end of a sequencing run.
    name: file_r1
    range: string
    title: File_R1
    required: true
  file_r2:
    description: Name of the sequencing file containing reads from the second end of a paired-end sequencing run. Required if and only if paired-end sequencing was done.
    name: file_r2
    range: string
    title: File_R2
    required: false
  is_paired_end:
    description: Indicate if paired-end sequencing was performed.
    name: is_paired_end
    range: boolean
    title: Is_Paired_End
    required: true
  library_name:
    description: Name of a sequencing library made from a molecular sample or a sample pool (multiplex sequencing).
    name: library_name
    range: string
    title: Library_Name
    required: true
  platform_unit:
    description: Unique identifier for each read group. For example, Illumina has format {FLOWCELL_BARCODE}.{LANE}.{SAMPLE_BARCODE}. The {FLOWCELL_BARCODE} refers to the unique identifier for a particular flow cell. The {LANE} indicates the lane of the flow cell and the {SAMPLE_BARCODE} is a sample/library-specific identifier. For non-multiplex sequencing, platform unit and read group have a one-to-one relationship.
    name: platform_unit
    range: string
    title: Platform_Unit
    required: true
  read_group_id_in_bam:
    description: Optional field indicating the @RD ID in the BAM. If submitted, this will be used to map the @RG ID in the BAM header to the submitter_read_group_id in the payload. After submission, the @RG ID in the payload will be used for all future headers. This cannot be submitted for FASTQ files.
    name: read_group_id_in_bam
    range: string
    title: Read_Group_Id_In_Bam
    required: false
  read_length_r1:
    description: Length of sequencing reads in file_r1; this corresponds to the number of sequencing cycles of the first end.
    name: read_length_r1
    range: integer
    title: Read_Length_R1
    required: false
  read_length_r2:
    description: Length of sequencing reads in file_r2; this corresponds to the number of sequencing cycles of the second end.
    name: read_length_r2
    range: integer
    title: Read_Length_R2
    required: false
  sample_barcode:
    description: According to the SAM specification, this is the expected barcode bases as read by the sequencing machine in the absence of errors.
    name: sample_barcode
    range: string
    title: Sample_Barcode
    required: false
  insert_size:
    description: For paired-end sequencing, the average size of sequences between two sequencing ends. Required only for paired-end sequencing.
    name: insert_size
    range: integer
    title: Insert_Size
    required: false
